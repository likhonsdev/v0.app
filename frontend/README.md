# V0.App Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), enhanced with comprehensive CI/CD and testing capabilities.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Automated builds and deployments
- Comprehensive testing suite
- TypeScript support
- Monaco Editor integration
- Automated code formatting
- Multiple deployment targets (Vercel, GitHub Pages)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

### Vercel (Primary Deployment)

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

- Automatic deployments on push to main
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Analytics and performance monitoring

### GitHub Pages (Secondary Deployment)

The app is also automatically deployed to GitHub Pages:
- Static export generated automatically
- Accessible through GitHub Pages URL
- Useful for documentation and demos
